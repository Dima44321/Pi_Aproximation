# Pi_Aproximation
Approximate Pi with one of Euler's formulas that states that the probability of two random numbers being coprime is pi squared divided by six. In other words, for random integers x and y P(gcd(x,y) = 1) = 6/pi^2

The program takes two inputs. "Cycles" determines how many pairs of numbers are tested, and "Upper Bound" determines the upper bound of the pool from which random integers are selected (lower bound is 1).
